## Introduction

Ifarmer is a Java Spring Boot-based backend application designed to handle various agricultural and farming operations. This includes managing users, posts, comments, likes, notifications, and more. The project is structured to support scalability, maintainability, and ease of integration with other systems such as frontend applications.

## Features

- **User Management:** Secure authentication, authorization, and profile management.
- **Post Management:** Create, edit, and delete posts with support for likes and comments.
- **Notification System:** Real-time notifications for various user activities (e.g., new posts, likes, comments).
- **Recent Activities Feed:** Aggregated view of the most recent activities, including new posts, comments, and likes.
- **Firebase Integration:** Push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Secure access to different parts of the application based on user roles.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrated logging to troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Architecture Overview

The Ifarmer application is built using the Spring Boot framework, following a layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.
2. **Service Layer:** Contains business logic and interacts with the data access layer.
3. **Repository Layer:** Manages database interactions using Spring Data JPA.
4. **Security Layer:** Manages authentication, authorization, and security configurations.

The application also integrates with third-party services such as Firebase for push notifications and supports real-time data synchronization.

## Modules and Key Components

- **User Module:** Manages user-related operations such as registration, authentication, profile updates, and role assignments.
- **Post Module:** Handles the creation, editing, deletion, and retrieval of posts, along with associated comments and likes.
- **Notification Module:** Manages notifications for user activities, including sending and retrieving notifications.
- **Firebase Integration:** Manages push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
